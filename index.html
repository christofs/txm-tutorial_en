## What is TXM?
* A text analysis tool developed at the ENS Lyon 
* Designed for linguistic or literary text analysis
* Indebted to and designed for "textométrie"
* Based on Unicode and XML, supports TEI
* Supports linguistic annotation and metadata
* Using the CQP corpus query processor (from Open Corpus Workbench)
* Flexible, free, open and in active development
* For more information, see: <http://textometrie.ens-lyon.fr/?lang=en>
</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Sample text collections
* 12 British novels by Arthur Conan Doyle
* Written in two different decades
* Belonging to four different subgenres: detective, adventure, horror, historical novel
<!-- #TODO: Make nice XML-based TXM binary corpus, put on Zenodo, link here. -->

# 1. Individual functions
</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Lexicon
List of all terms (which can be word forms, lemmas, POS, etc.) which appear in the corpus. 
* Can be sorted alphabetically or by frequency
* Useful to find most frequent and very rare words
</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Index
Function to find out the frequency of a certain term in the corpus
* Gives a list of found terms and their frequency
* It is possible to set the property of the term that should be shown (word, lemma, POS or combination)
* Important conceptual distinction: property of the query vs. property displayed
* Further tools can be started from here
</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Concordance
Search which displays the context of a certain term
* This function shows the hits in context, with some words appearing before and some words following
* Includes a reference to the document in which each hit was found
* Again, the property of the hits to be shown can be customized
</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Cooccurrences
Search for terms which typically appear together with a target term (many options!)
* `cooccurrent`: the term cooccurring with the target term
* `frequency`: absolute frequency of the cooccurring terms;
* `cofrequency`: absolute frequency with which target term and found term occur together
* `score`: measure for the degree of specificity of a cooccurrence (most relevant)
* `mean distance`: mean distance between the target terms and the found term
</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
# 2. Several search modes
<br/>
<p>(Depending on the annotations present)</p>
</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Word forms
Search for graphical word forms
* `"worked"`  - the simplest mode; finds the number of times "worked" occurs
* `[word="worked"]` - same, but this query can be enhanced more easily (see below)</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Lemmas
Search for all terms which correspond to a specific lemma (base form)
* `[enlemma="mouse"]` – finds all terms corresponding to the lemma "mouse" in its different forms: "mouse", "mice"
* The label used is language dependent: `enlemma`, `pllemma`, `frlemma`, `eslemma`, etc.
</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Part-of-Speech
Search for all terms which belong to a certain grammatical category.
* `[enpos="VV"]` - finds any verb: "was", "is", "had", etc. 
* `[enpos="JJ"]` - finds any adjective: "other", "great", "little". 
* Again, the label is language-dependent: `frpos`, `plpos`, etc.
* The inventory of POS-Tags depends on the language model used by TreeTagger; see <http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/>; 
</script>
</section>

<section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
# 3. Advanced search queries
</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Sequence of several search termsss
One search term followed by another search term. (See also the Query Editor!)
* `[word="she"][word="did"]` - finds the number of hits for the sequence "she did".
It is possible to combine several search modes
* `[enpos="JJ"][enlemma="house"]` - finds hits in which an adjective is followed by any word form based on the lemma "house": for example, "great house", "empty house" and "old house".
</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Search terms in a certain distance
Several search terms with a minimal (and maximal) distance between them:
* `[enpos="VV"][]{0,5}[enlemma="money"]` - finds all combinations of a verb, followed by 0 to 5 words of any kind, followed by the lemma "money": for example, "take his money" and "add to the money" and "do to raise the money". </script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Combination of criteria for one term
Combines several criteria of different types for one single term, for example criteria concerning the word for and the grammatical category
*  `[word="dog" & enpos="VV"]` - finds all terms which are written "dog" AND are a verb (to dog = to follow someone). This notably excludes all cases in which "dog" is a noun
</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
# 4. Symbols to enhance queries
</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## The wildcard and quantifiers
* `.` dot = wildcard: any word character (but not a whitespace)
* `*` asterisk = the character (or: group or entire term) immediately preceding has to be present zero or several times
* `+` plus = ... has to be present at least once or several times
* `?` question mark = ... has to be present either zero times or once, but not more than once
</section>


<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Examples
* `[word="go.?"]` - words which starts with "go" and has zero or one more characters. Finds: "go" and "got", but not "goes" (two more characters)
* `[word="f.*ic" & enpos="JJ"]` - words starting with an "f" and ending on "ic" which are adjectives. Finds: "fantastic" and "frantic".
* `[word="go"][enpos="RB"]+` - The word "go" followd by one or several adverbs. Finds: "go away" and "go down again" etc. 
<!-- #TODO: Report error in TXM, does not use the quantififer correctly -->
</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Some more useful symbols 
* `{x}` = numerical indicator. Indicates how many times the previous character or term should be present.
* `{x,y}` = numerical range. Indicates the minimum and maximum number the previous character or term should be present
* `%c` = ignore uppercase/lowercase distinction (add after the quotation marks)
* `%d` = ignore accents and diacritics (add after quotation marks). The combination `%cd` is also possible.</script>
</section>


<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Examples:
* `[word="heaven"%c]` – finds: "heaven" (physical) und "Heaven" (metaphysical / or at sentence-initial position).
* `[word="the"][enpos="JJ"]{2}[enpos="NN"]` - wildcard on the level of terms; sequence of "the", then two adjectives, then one noun. Finds "the deep blue sky" and "the angry old man". 
</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Alternatives and negation
Find several search terms at a time (using the "|" pipe character)
* `[word="city|village"]` - alternatives concerning word forms; finds all passages containing either "city" or "village"
* `[enpos="DT|PP"]` - alternatives concerning the part-of-speech; finds all articles and personal pronouns: "the", "a", "it", "you", etc.
Use negation to exclude certain results
* `[enpos="NP" & word!="Holmes"]` - find all proper names except Holmes. Compare with `[enpos="NP"]`
</script>

# 5. Structuring a corpus
</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Define a sub-corpus
Only a specific part of the corpus goes into the subcorpus 
* Right-click on "DOYLE", choose `subcorpus`
* Give the subcorpus a name, for instance "historical" 
* Stay in the `simple` tab and adapt the settings: structure="text", property="subgenre". Confirm.
* From the list of subgenres, select "historical"; done! 
* (For more complex scenarios, use the assisted and advanced modes)</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Partition a corpus
Add an internal structure to the corpus based on metadata
* Right-click on `DOYLE`, choose `partition` 
* Give the partition a name, e.g. "decades". 
* Stay in the `simple` tab and adapt the settings: structure="text", property="decade". Confirm.
* The corpus will be automatically subdivided according to decade.
* (Right-click on your partition and select `Dimensions` to find out about the proportions in your partition.)

# 6. Comparative analyses</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Progression
* In Index oder Lexicon, right-click on a term
* Choose `Send to progression` 
* Graph type: select `cumulative` or `density`
* Bandwith multiplier: set to "0.5" (or vary between 0.2 und 1.0)
* Structural unit: select "text"
* Property: select "subgenre" or "title"; Confirm</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Specificities
* Click on a partition, then right-click
* Select `specificities` 
* Define a `property` (for example "word")
* `Part focus`: leave empty to compare all partitions; confirm.
</script>

# 7. Import / Export</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Various import formats
* Using the functions provided in `File>Import`
* Directly from the clipboard (single text)
* From a folder with text files (with optional `metadata.csv` file) 
* From a folder with XML/TEI files (with optional `metadata.csv` file) 
</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Import options
* `Main language`: for linguistic annotation; make sure to select the right language (requirement: TreeTagger and relevant language parameter file)
* `Metadata preview`: check if you have a metadata.csv file. One column needs to be called `id` with entries corresponding to the file names. 
</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Exporting results
* The results of any query can be exported as a CSV file (comma-separated values) - with some caveats 
* Any graph can be exported as an SVG file (scalable vector graphics)
</script>
